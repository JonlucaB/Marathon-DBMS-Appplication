Hello!

This personal project was inspired by my mother's business. She is the CEO of Travel Abundance, an Austin based luxury travel agency, and she frequently
expressed the need for a better databse system than her current filing cabinet solution. With that in mind, I took it upon myself to create a rudimentary
DBMS application that runs locally on my system. As I can't afford to keep a test server up and running 24/7, I don't see much benifit in doing anything more than showing
my raw code and providing (hopefully in the future) a video demonstrating its functionality. 

This application lets the user login to a MySQL database, and with their appropriate priveleges they can view, search, insert, delete, and edit the data. The data
consists of basic member data for a hypothetical marathon. It contains an auto-incrementing ID, name, date of birth, gender, and rank/placement in the marathon.
